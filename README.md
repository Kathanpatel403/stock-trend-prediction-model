# stock-trend-prediction-model
Welcome to the Stock Trend Prediction Model repository! This project utilizes a Linear Regression model to forecast stock market trends, making use of Python's powerful libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for efficient data preprocessing. With Matplotlib, we perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis to gain valuable insights from historical stock price data. To enhance usability, we have integrated this model with a web interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS. This integration allows you to conveniently input stock data and obtain predictions in real-time. Whether you're a data enthusiast, an aspiring investor, or a trader seeking additional insights, our project offers a versatile tool to assist you in making well-informed investment decisions. Explore my code, follow the instructions in the README to set up the environment, and start using the model to gain a competitive edge in the stock market.
