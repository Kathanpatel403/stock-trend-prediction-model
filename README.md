# Stock Trend Prediction Model 📈📊

## Project Overview 🚀

This project involves developing and deploying a **stock price trend prediction** system powered by machine learning. The application integrates **data science**, **web development**, **containerization**, and **cloud deployment**, providing a scalable and automated solution for predicting stock trends.

---

## Project Highlights 💡

- **Model Development:**  
  The model is trained using the **XGBoost** algorithm, capturing complex patterns in historical stock data. The trained model is saved for future predictions. 🤖
  
- **Backend Integration:**  
  Built with **Flask**, the backend handles user requests, processes data, and predicts stock trends. The frontend is developed using **HTML** for easy user interaction. 🌐

- **Containerization:**  
  The entire application is **Dockerized** for portability. The Docker image is pushed to **Docker Hub**, ensuring easy access and deployment across different environments. 🐳

- **AWS Deployment:**  
  Deployed on **AWS EC2** with **Kubernetes** for **scalable** and **efficient** hosting of the application. ☁️

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  Using **Jenkins**, the project implements an automated continuous integration and delivery pipeline. Changes pushed to **GitHub** automatically trigger Docker builds, update the Docker Hub image, and deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster on **AWS EC2**. 🔄

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Python 
- Flask 
- HTML, CSS 
- Docker 
- Kubernetes 
- Jenkins 
- GitHub 
- AWS EC2

## Data Preprocessing 🔄

The project uses historical stock data for trend prediction. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature scaling, feature engineering, and splitting data into training and test sets. 📊

---

## Model Training 🏋️‍♂️

The machine learning model is trained using libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn**. The model is designed to predict stock price movements based on historical data and is integrated into the web application. 📈

---

## Backend Development 🖥️

The backend is powered by **Flask**. The `app.py` file contains the Flask application code, which handles incoming requests, processes stock data, and delivers predictions. The frontend HTML templates are stored in the `templates/` directory. 💻

---

## Containerization and Deployment 🚢

- **Dockerization:**  
  The project is containerized using **Docker**. The Docker image is built and pushed to **Docker Hub** for easy deployment. 🐳

- **AWS EC2 Deployment with Kubernetes:**  
    - A Kubernetes cluster is created on **AWS EC2** to manage the deployment and scaling of the application. ☁️

- **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins:**  
    - **Jenkins** is used to automate the CI/CD pipeline. It fetches the latest changes from **GitHub**, builds new Docker images, pushes them to Docker Hub, and deploys them to the Kubernetes cluster on AWS. 🔄

---

## Continuous Integration & Deployment 🔄

- **Jenkins Pipeline Setup:**  
    - Configured **Jenkins** to monitor changes in the **GitHub** repository.  
    - Automatic **Docker** builds and image pushes to **Docker Hub** upon each commit.  
    - Deployment to the **Kubernetes** cluster on **AWS** for continuous delivery. 📦

---

## Conclusion 🎯

This project demonstrates the integration of **machine learning**, **web development**, **containerization**, and **cloud-based deployment**. The automated **CI/CD** pipeline with **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** ensures seamless updates and scalable deployment of the stock trend prediction application. 🚀
